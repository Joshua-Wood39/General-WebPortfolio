# General-WebPortfolio
For passion and insatiable curiosity.
Welcome to the start of my new career!
I have been a coder since Apple IIe computers were in style, and I am currently a student at Lambda School in the Full-Stack Web Development track. Having a background in game coding (using C#), I'm excited to share my projects and achievements here on GitHub.
I hope you enjoy!
